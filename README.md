## 🍽️ GenAI Restaurant Review

An AI-powered restaurant review intelligence platform that transforms customer feedback into actionable insights using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Generative AI.

## Overview

GenAI Restaurant Review is designed to help restaurants understand customer experiences beyond star ratings. The platform analyzes reviews, identifies complaint categories, detects emotions, performs sentiment analysis, generates summaries, and provides business intelligence through AI-driven analytics.

The project combines:

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Machine Learning (ML)
Deep Learning (DL)
Generative AI (GenAI)
Data Analytics
to extract meaningful insights from restaurant reviews collected from platforms such as Yelp, Google Reviews, and other public review sources.
